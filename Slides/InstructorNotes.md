# Instructor notes
## Overview 
This course originates from the 2933A course provided by Microsoft 2006, and has been updated every year since then. By moving the course to GitHub we hope to share the work of keeping it updated. Feel free to use, fork and contribute with material such as labs and modules. 

The course includes slides, demos, hands-on-labs and lab material. The course also assumes each student (and trainer) has access to a BizTalk environment which has been properly set up.

There are currently 14 default modules and some extra modules which can be used depending on the audience.

Each module starts with the trainer presenting for the module slide-deck which often includes a set of demos. Each module includes one lab, however the lab may be split up in exercises where the trainer continues to present between the exercises. Most labs have optional exercises for students who are quicker than others.

## Getting started
All themes have been removed from all slides. Begin by copying the **Default.potx** file and modify it to work with your profile. 

Open each slide-deck, go to *View -> Slide Master* and click *Themes* and browse to your theme file. Click **Close Master View** to go back to the slide-deck

## Share your work
We encourage you to create your own labs and modules. Feel free to fork the project send us pull-requests.
